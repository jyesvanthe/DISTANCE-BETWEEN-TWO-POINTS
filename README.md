# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
import math from the module
### Step 2: 
define the coordinates of x,y for two points
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
store the result in another variable
### Step 5: 
print the result
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1,y1=10,6
x2,y2=4,2
d=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))

```
